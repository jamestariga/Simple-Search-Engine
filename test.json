During military campaigns against the rebels, he encounters the ambitious Cui Lin, who is the only daughter of General Cui Yi, the commander of the Cui family army. Cui Lin concealed her true identity and disguised herself as Lieutenant He, fighting alongside the army. They cross paths with each other many times on the battlefields.
